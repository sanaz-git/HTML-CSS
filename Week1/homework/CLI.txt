1: How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
use mkdir to create a file and then hide file by add "." at the beginning of the name of file. We can see hidden files by type " ls -a ".

2: How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
by this code: " mkdir -p /myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun " .

3: How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message
by this code: 'echo "first message" >> CLI.txt' and  'echo "second message" >> CLI.txt' .
